# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis


* Tools Used: PostgreSQL, pgAdmin4, Excel

# Overview
  The purpose of this assignment was to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 
  
  
  ## Results
  
  * I first created an ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) to turn the data sets into a digestable visual; and to high the connections between the data that were used in the analysis.

  * There are 56,859 employees who are eligible for mentorship, due to this many long term employees we can deduce that PW is a fantastic place for employee satisfaction; and that they will need to prepare for large scale retirements in the near term and have a hiring plan in place to replace all this talent.
